# Scenario: tui_focus_in_reasserts_input_grab (bug-tui-focus-fix)
#
# Pins the general fix for the "wg TUI leaks first keystrokes to tmux after OS
# focus-in" bug (docs/bugs/tui-focus-input-race.md). The wg TUI used to set its
# terminal input grab exactly once at startup and be structurally blind to
# focus changes, so returning OS focus to the window (alt-tab / click) left a
# window in which the user's first keystroke was parsed by tmux instead of wg
# (popping choose-tree, etc.).
#
# The fix has two halves, both directly observable in the TUI's raw output
# stream under a real PTY (no tmux/emulator needed — the assertions are at wg's
# own layer):
#
#   Defect 2 (subscribe to focus): wg now enables DECSET 1004 focus reporting
#     at startup — the byte \x1b[?1004h appears in the startup output.
#   Defect 1 (re-assert grab on focus-in): when wg receives a focus-in report
#     (\x1b[I), it re-emits its own input grab as one burst — bracketed paste
#     (\x1b[?2004h) and mouse capture (\x1b[?1002h) — before the next key.
#
# Both bytes are ABSENT on the pre-fix `main`:
#   * main never emits \x1b[?1004h (no EnableFocusChange anywhere in src), and
#   * main drops Event::FocusGained via a catch-all arm, so a focus-in triggers
#     no re-assert at all (no second \x1b[?2004h, no re-emitted \x1b[?1002h).
# So this scenario fails on main and passes after the fix.
#
# Idle TUI redraws never emit DECSET mode-set sequences (ratatui emits only
# cursor/style/text), so seeing \x1b[?2004h *after* the focus-in injection is an
# unambiguous signal of the re-assert, not a coincidental repaint.
#
# Exit 0  = PASS
# Exit 77 = SKIP (no python3 / no wg)
# Exit 1  = FAIL
