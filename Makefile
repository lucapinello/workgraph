# Regenerate the committed, version-locked plugin bundle the wg binary embeds.
# Run this after editing anything under pi-plugin/src/** or bumping the
# WG_PI_PLUGIN_COMPAT_VERSION const. Requires node + npm (NOT needed for a plain
# `cargo install` — the bytes are committed).

# Anti-drift gate (used by CI): re-embed, then fail if the committed bundle
# differs from a fresh build. A source edit without a re-embed is caught here.

# Build and install the pinned Pi 0.80.6 source with WG's maintained EPIPE
# patch. This is an explicit source-package install, never an in-place edit of
# an arbitrary global node_modules tree.
