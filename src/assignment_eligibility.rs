//! Assignment pool separation — the structural split between **work
//! agents** and **system evaluation agents**.
//!
//! WG has two agent pools that must never be mixed at assignment time:
//!
//! - the **work pool** — ordinary implementation/operation workers
//!   (Programmer, Architect, Documenter, …) eligible for user/work task
//!   assignment;
//! - the **system evaluation pool** — the agency meta + review personas
//!   (`Reviewer`, `Evaluator`, `Assigner`, `Evolver`, `Agent Creator`)
//!   that exist to run the evaluation/review/assignment *primitives*, not
//!   implementation work.
//!
//! The observed failure mode this module prevents: WG creates many
//! `.evaluate-*` / `.flip-*` / review tasks, so the system evaluation
//! agents accumulate heavy historical usage and high scores. The lightweight
//! LLM assigner sees that usage and then picks an evaluator/reviewer persona
//! for an implementation/intake/build task — which then behaves as an
//! evaluator (reports missing implementation, no-ops, retries) until the task
//! fails. Two recent failures of exactly this shape were `build-real-async`
//! and `register-refreshed-e97-seed-latest`.
//!
//! The fix here is **structural, not heuristic**. The earlier
//! `prevent-evaluator-reviewer` guard guessed at implementation verbs in the
//! task title/tags and filtered the pool only when it thought the task
//! "looked like" implementation work. That left every neutral-looking task
//! ("Triage incoming issues", "Set up the intake pipeline", …) exposed to a
//! system-agent pick whenever the evaluator/reviewer had the highest score.
//! This module replaces that with a pool split keyed on the **task kind**:
//!
//! - **Evaluation/review primitives** ([`task_is_evaluation_or_review`]) —
//!   `.evaluate-*`, `.flip-*`, `.assign-*` scaffolding use the system
//!   evaluation pool (or, in practice, the inline one-shot dispatch path).
//! - **Everything else** ([`task_uses_work_pool`]) is a normal work task and
//!   uses the **work pool only** — system evaluation agents are excluded
//!   from the candidate set *before* the LLM assigner ever sees them,
//!   regardless of historical frequency, recent success, or LLM preference.
//!
//! Design rules (kept deliberately narrow so the split is predictable):
//!
//! 1. **A normal work task never offers a system evaluation agent** as a
//!    candidate — [`filter_work_pool_agents`] is the structural front door.
//! 2. **An evaluation/review primitive** keeps access to the system pool —
//!    the guard never blocks evaluator/FLIP routing.
//! 3. **Explicit human pinning wins**, but a system agent pinned to a work
//!    task warns loudly ([`EligibilityVerdict::Warn`]) so the operator sees
//!    the role/pool mismatch.
//! 4. **Auto-assignment** that nonetheless lands on a system agent for a work
//!    task (e.g. an assigner that bypassed the filtered pool, or a stale
//!    role resolution) is mutated to [`EligibilityVerdict::Reassign`],
//!    carrying a fallback work agent when one exists. When no work agent is
//!    available, the caller must **fail loudly** with a configuration error
//!    — it must never silently keep the system agent.
//!
//! The earlier verb/tag implementation heuristic ([`task_requires_implementation`]
//! and [`role_implementation_capability`]) is retained as a *secondary* hint
//! (e.g. to surface a fallback implementation-capable worker), but it is no
//! longer the gate — the pool kind is.
