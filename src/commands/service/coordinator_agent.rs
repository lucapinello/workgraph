//! Persistent coordinator agent: a long-lived LLM session inside the service daemon.
//!
//! Spawns a Claude CLI process with `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json`
//! and keeps it running for the lifetime of the daemon. User chat messages are injected
//! via stdin, and responses are captured from stdout and written to the chat outbox.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - The daemon creates a `CoordinatorAgent` on startup.
//! - Chat messages are sent via `CoordinatorAgent::send_message()`.
//! - A dedicated reader thread parses stdout and writes responses to the outbox.
//! - The agent subprocess is auto-restarted on crash with context recovery.
//!
//! Crash recovery:
//! - Time-windowed restart rate limiting: max 3 restarts per 10 minutes.
//! - On restart, injects previous conversation summary and current graph state.
//! - Conversation history persisted via chat inbox/outbox JSONL files.
//! - Old history is rotated on restart to prevent unbounded growth.
//!
//! Context refresh:
//! - On each user message, a context update is injected with graph summary,
//!   recent events, active agents, and items needing attention.
//! - Events are tracked in a bounded ring buffer (`EventLog`) shared between
//!   the daemon main thread and the agent thread.
